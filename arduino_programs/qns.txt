1. Write an Arduino sketch to detect an object(car) in the parking lot using Ultrasonic
 Sensor and measure the distance to consecutive objects(cars) parked.

2. Using the Light Sensor, monitor the surrounding light density and automatically 
turn ON/OFF the high Intensity LED’s by taking some Pre defined Threshold Light
 Intensity Value.

3. To interface Push button/Digital sensor  with Arduino and write a program to ‘turn ON’
 LED when push button is pressed or at sensor detection.

4. To interface IR sensor with Arduino and write a program to ‘turn ON’ LED when push button 
is pressed or at sensor detection.

5. To interface DHT11 sensor with Arduino and write a program to print temperature and 
humidity readings for a given period of time in the console.

6. Using a raindrop sensor detect the raindrop and make the buzzer to buzz each time
a drop is been detected.
